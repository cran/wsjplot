Title: Style Time Series Plots Like the Wall Street Journal
Description: Easily override the default visual choices in 'ggplot2' to make 
    your time series plots look more like the Wall Street Journal. Specific 
    theme design choices include omitting x-axis grid lines and displaying 
    sparse light grey y-axis grid lines. Additionally, this allows to label 
    the y-axis scales with your units only displayed on the top-most number, 
    while also removing the bottom most number (unless specifically 
    overridden). The goal is visual simplicity, because who has time to waste 
    looking at a cluttered graph?
